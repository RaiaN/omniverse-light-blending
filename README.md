# NVIDIA Omniverse Light Blending Extension

This extension allows to smoothly interpolate light parameters (i.e. intensity) taking into account current camera position. Typical scenario is a view-dependent light to do separate shots without toggling on and off any light source.

Supported light types: Sphere Light, Distant Light, Disk Light.

Disk Light is turned into a blinking light to showcase capabilities of the plugin and how easy it is to add more light types.
